Arduino_Lib_in_CPP
==================
This part is the sample library for my school Project. From this easy sample, you may easily create your own C++ library for Arduino Project.

TKBlockDetector.cpp is to detect the block of the robot.
TKMetalDetector.cpp is to detect the metal of the robot.

WildThumperBasicTK.cpp is to drive the Wild Thumper robot by remote control or driving by itself.
